## JavaScriptPractice
These projects are derived from the "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu. While the ideas and structure of these projects are inspired by the course, all code and solutions were developed independently as part of my learning journey.

Each project demonstrates my understanding and application of full-stack development concepts, including front-end and back-end technologies, problem-solving skills, and ability to build complete web applications.

Feel free to explore the repositories, and I welcome any contributions, feedback, or suggestions!
