## JavaScriptPractice
These practices are based on concepts from The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu. While the structure and ideas draw inspiration from the course, all codes and solutions were developed independently as part of my personal learning journey.

Each project showcases my understanding and application of full-stack development skills, encompassing front-end and back-end technologies, problem-solving abilities, and the capacity to create fully functional web applications.

I invite you to explore the repositories and would appreciate any contributions, feedback, or suggestions!
